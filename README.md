# COVID-Analysis---Analyzing-the-Impact-of-COVID-19-Pandemic
This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a global scale. The project is built on a dataset that includes daily reports on COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries across the world. The dataset is updated daily to provide the most up-to-date information.

The analysis includes various data visualization techniques, statistical analysis, and machine learning algorithms to gain insights into the pandemic's impact. The project provides an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore the data and visualize the trends and patterns over time.

The analysis covers a range of topics, including the spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the impact on the economy, and the effectiveness of different containment measures. The project aims to provide a comprehensive view of the pandemic's impact and help policymakers make informed decisions.

The project is built using Python and various data analysis libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project is open source, and contributions are welcome. It is our hope that this project will contribute to the global effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic by providing valuable insights and information to researchers, policymakers, and the general public.
